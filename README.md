### Twin.macro

This project uses twin.macro which is an glue of CSS-in-JS and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/). You can read more about the project [here](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro).

To make the CSS-in-JS happen twin uses underneath [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/) and this allows the developer to mix Tailwind utility classes with pure css, more on this topic [here](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro/blob/master/docs/prop-styling-guide.md) and [here](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro/blob/master/docs/styled-component-guide.md)

Have fun! ❤️
